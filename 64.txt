Thechatbotisacomputer,programmedtoemulatedialogueswithhumansusingvoice

âChatbot is an acronym for chat robot and it establishes communication with humans
utilizing AI technology and underlying computer program inbuilt in itâ (Ramachandran,
2018,p.1).AsperAdametal.(2020,p.2),âAI-basedChatbotisaparticulartypeofchatbot
that is designed for turn-by-turn conversations with human users based on the textual
input.â An AI-based chatbot (hereafter simply âchatbotsâ) is an integration of intelligent
backend systems and an interface (Guzman and Pathania, 2016). The chatbot interface
access may happen through unique devices such as Google, Siri and Amazon Alexa,
computers andsmartphones.Theinteractionwitha chatbotcanoccurthroughtextualor
vocal format. Chatbot interactions are supported by intelligent backend systems, which
facilitate the interaction process with end-users (Sheehan, 2018). The increasing adoption
and use of digital intelligent assistants and chatbots are offering conversational system
capabilities for sales, marketing and customer service purposes. Because of machine
learning and intelligent software algorithms, they provide human-like conversations that
are more engaging to the customers (SAP, 2018). The earlier versions of chatbots were
simple response platforms, whereas the current AI-based chatbots are much more
sophisticated, powerful and capable, increasing the humanâtechnology interaction (Rajan
and Saffiotti, 2017). In the hospitality and tourism industry, chatbots are used for travel
planning, customer booking, customer support and providing recommendations and
suggestions to the customer regarding travel issues. Chatbots are helping tourism
companiesfor24/7customersupport,morerevenueopportunities,improvedengagement,
automatic lead capturing, reduced overhead cost, competitive advantage and time saving
(Bowen and Morosan, 2018; Sheehan, 2018). Companies such as Makemytrip, Expedia,
Kayak, Skyscanner and Cheapflights have started using chatbots for customer service
(Tomhawk,2017).ThesurveyofAspectresearchsoftwareshowsthat44\%ofconsumers
are looking forward to using AI-based chatbots over human customer care executives
(Sweezey,2018).Technologyisimpactingallgenerationsanditisrequiredtocomprehend

possiblefutureimplementationsanditsimpacts(IvanovandWebster,2019a,2019b;Tung

2.Literaturereview
Adoptionofchatbotstechnologyisanemergingsubjectofresearchandmanystudieshave
beendoneworldwideinvariouscontexts.Thestudiesconductedforadoptionandusageof
chatbot technologies are travel, tourism and hospitality companies (Ivanov and Webster,
2019b), service chatbots (Sheehan, 2018), hotel interactive technologies (Morosan and
DeFranco,2019),servicerobots(Belancheetal.,2020;Mendeetal.,2019),chatbotsingeneral
(BrandtzaegandFÃ¸lstad,2017)andchatbotsadoptioninSiricase(IoandLee,2019).Extant
studiesarealsodiscussingthechatbots/robotsfortourismandhumaninteraction(Yu,2020;
Mirnigetal.,2017;Stadleretal.,2014;Rosenthal-vonderPÃ¼ttenetal.,2017).Tostudythe
adoption of chatbots for tourism, TAM along with humanârobot interaction (HRI)
variablesâANM,PNT,technologyanxietyandPTRâareconsideredwhicharecontext-
specifictochatbotsfortourismapplications.
2.1Theoreticalbasis
2.1.1Technologyadoptionmodel.TAMisanextensivelyusedandacknowledgedmodelin
technology adoption research and it investigates the behavioral intention to adopt new
technology. The userâs conviction regarding perceived ease of use (PEA) and perceived
usefulness(PUL)ofanewtechnologyimpactstheuserintention(Davis,1989).TAMwas
usedtostudytheadoptionofsocialmediaforselectingtouristdestinations(Huaetal.,2017),
self-servicehoteltechnology(Kaushiketal.,2015),Web-basedself-servicetechnologyinthe
hospitality industry (Lee, 2013) and e-tourism in Egyptian tourism companies (Ghanem
et al., 2017). As chatbots are an emerging technology in the travel and tourism industry,IJCHM hencetounderstandthebehavioralintentiontoadoptchatbotsfortourismplanning,TAM
isconsideredinthisresearchwork.
2.1.2Humanârobotinteraction.TheextantresearchworkdiscussestheHRI(Bartneck
et al., 2009; Deshmukh et al., 2018; Ho and Macdorman, 2010; Yu, 2020; Sheehan, 2018;
Bartnecketal.,2007;GrayandWegner,2012).Theservicerobotsorchatbotsâperformance

amongitsusersasarobotâsperceptioncannotbemeasured.HRIisamulti-disciplinaryarea
andtherearefivekeydimensionstestedbydevelopingtheGodspeedquestionnaire:ANM,
PNT,likeability,animacyandperceivedsafety(Bartnecketal.,2009).Thisscaleiswidely
usedtounderstandtheHRI(Sheehan,2018;Yu,2020;HoandMacdorman,2010;Starketal.,
2018; Weiss and Bartneck, 2015; Werner et al., 2012; Willemse and Wykowska, 2019;
Zaroualietal.,2018;McGinnetal.,2019;Petiscaetal.,2015;Hughesetal.,2015).Thisstudy
mainlyfocusesontourismchatbots;hence,thisstudyhasconsideredANMandPNTfrom
theGodspeedquestionnaire.
2.1.3 Anthropomorphism. Inroboticstudies,mainlytheuncannyvalleytheoryisused
verywidely.GrayandWegner(2012),Bartnecketal.(2007)andMori(1970)proposedthis
theory of uncanny valley which discusses that the people tend to be positive about the
things/products which have anthropomorphic features; however, this relationship is not
necessarilylinearalways. ANMis considered as thedegree to whichconsumers perceive
robotsandothernon-humanobjects ashuman-like(Ruijtenetal., 2019, p.1).Thestudies
discussedtheanthropomorphiccharacteristicsofchatbotsandrobots(Sheehan,2018;Yu,
2020;WillemseandWykowska,2019;Zaroualietal.,2018;Hughesetal.,2015;Rietzetal.,
2019). It is discussed that chatbotâs small talk usage changed the usersâ perception that
chatbots are intelligent, reliable and trustworthy (Cassell and Bickmore, 2003). ANM
increasestheconfidenceandsenseofcontrol;hence,itaidstodevelopapositiveattitudinal
response in consumers (Epley et al., 2007; Ho and Macdorman, 2010). Hence, ANM is
consideredinthisworktotesttheadoptionofchatbotsintourismplanningtounderstand
itsextentofhuman-likeperceptionduringHRIamongitsusers.
2.1.4 Perceived intelligence. The AI has developed the concept of PNT (Ho and
Macdorman, 2010; Warner and Sugarman, 1986) and it mainly concentrates on
competence, knowledge delivery, sensibility, intelligence and responsible reaction of
robot or chatbot (Weiss and Bartneck, 2015; Petisca et al., 2015; McGinn et al., 2019;
Hughesetal.,2015).Itischallengingforrobotstointeractwithcustomersintelligently
(Bartnecketal.,2009).Itiseasyforcustomerstopointoutthelimitationofarobotwhile

(MoussawiandKoufaris,2019;Moussawietal.,2020).PNTisvitalforHRI.Itisalsoa

considersPNTasitinvolvestheelementofHRIandcollaborationtoprovidecompetent

2.1.5Perceivedtrust.PTRisdiscussedastheextenttowhichtheconsumerssensethat

Gallimoreetal.,2019).Consumersfeelsafewhentrustisdevelopedtowardrobots(Youetal.,
2018). PTR in HRI plays a vital role and it is mainly associated with an individualâs
intentions of risk-taking by trusting the trustee which shows the reliance behavior of
individuals(Mayeretal.,1995).Trustisacrucialaspectintheadoptionofnewtechnologysuch as robot and chatbots (Lee et al., 2017; Kaushik et al., 2015; Park and Gretzel, 2007; Chatbotsfor
McLeanetal.,2020).Hence,PTRisconsideredinthisresearchtounderstandthereliance hospitalityand
behaviorofconsumersandtheirfeelingsofcredibilitywhileinteractingwithchatbotsfor tourism
tourismplanning.
2.1.6 Technology anxiety. Technologyanxietydevelopsconfusiontowardtheusageof
technologyregardingtheactivitytobeconductedandhencereducesthewilinesstoadopt
new technology (Lam et al., 2008; Meuter et al., 2005). Technology anxiety creates
apprehensionandfearintheconsumerâsmindtowardusingnewtechnology(Igbariaand
Parasuraman,1989;Venkatesh,2000).Inthisregard,technologyanxietyisconsideredasa
crucial psychological antecedent which influences the adoption of new technology (Mani
andChouk,2018;Evanschitzkyetal.,2015).
2.1.7 Stickiness. Stickiness means the websiteâs capacity to retain the attention of the
user for a longer period (Gillespie, et al., 1999; Demers and Lev, 2001; Maciag, 2000).
Stickinessisalsostudiedregardingmobileapplicationsanditmeansthedegreetowhich
mobileappusersrevisitthemobiletocontinuetheusage(Racherlaetal.,2012;Kimetal.,
2016;HsuandLin,2016).Sivathanu(2019)studiedtheadoptionofdigitalpaymentsystems
and discussed âStickinessâ as the usersâ intention to continue usage of traditional cash
payment systems than the new digital payment systems. Stickiness in this work is
considered as the travelersâ intention to continue booking their travel plans through
traditionalhumantravelplanners/agentsthanusingthechatbotsfortourism.
2.2Theoreticalframeworkdevelopment
TAMisusedtoexaminetheadoptionofchatbotsfortourismasitiscomprehensiveand
widely used to study adoption of technology for tourism (Hua et al., 2017; Kaushik et al.,
2015; Ghanem et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) and adoption of chatbots and robot studies
(Zaroualietal.,2018;Leeetal.,2017).
Along with TAM, context-specific variables concerning HRI (Bartneck et al., 2009;
Deshmukhetal.,2018;HoandMacdorman,2010;Yu,2020;Sheehan,2018;Bartnecketal.,
2007; Gray and Wegner, 2012) are considered to provide better explanatory power. The
consideredvariablesofHRIareANM(Ruijtenetal.,2019),PNT(WeissandBartneck,2015;
Petiscaetal.,2015;McGinnetal.,2019;Hughesetal.,2015),PTR(YagodaandGillan,2012;
You et al., 2018; Gallimore et al., 2019) andtechnology anxiety (Evanschitzkyet al., 2015;

3.1Perceivedeaseofuse
PEAis theextent to whicha consumerbelieves that usinga particular system would be
easy and free of effort. PEA is an antecedent of behavioral intention to use technology

3.2Perceivedusefulness
PUL is the degree to which a consumer perceives that using a particular system would

3.3Technologicalanxiety
Technological anxiety (TXN) is the extent to which a consumer has a feeling of fear or
apprehensionthatmightbefacedduringtheusageoftechnology(Meuteretal.,2003).TXN
isoneoftheimportantvariableswhichisdiscussedasavitalpsychologicalantecedentof
technology adoption (Meuter et al., 2005). TXN may reduce motivation because of the
confusion of task performance (Meuter et al., 2005). The research found that TXN of
individuals can lead to avoiding the usage of technology tools (Meuter et al., 2005;
Parasuraman, 2000) and it is an obstacle for the adoption of new technology (Mani and
Chouk,2018).Therefore,itnegativelyaffectsthetechnologyadoption(Evanschitzkyetal.,
2015).Inthetourismindustry,chatbotsareanewtechnology,whichconsumersuseinmanyways for travel planning purposes; hence, TXN of tourists may affect the adoption of Chatbotsfor
chatbotsnegatively: hospitalityand
tourism
H3. TXNnegativelyaffectstheAINofchatbotsfortourism.
3.4Perceivedtrust
As per Komiak and Benbasat (2003), trust means the extent to which a consumer feels
securedaboutconductingatransactionwiththeserviceprovider.Also,trustisconsidered
as the willingness of the consumer to take a risk (Ba and Pavlou, 2002). In innovation
research, the development of trust in e-service providers is a vital topic of investigation
(Komiak and Benbasat, 2003). PTR depicts the consumersâ perceptions such as privacy
protection,qualityoftheinformationandthesecurityprovidedbytheinformationsystem
(Ponteetal.,2015).Thetourismtechnologyresearchconfirmsthepositiveeffectoftruston
the behavioral intention to adopt self-service hotel technology (Kaushik et al., 2015),
smartphoneapps (Guptaetal., 2017),onlinetravelpurchase(Ponteetal., 2015),anonline
website providing information through live chat assistants (McLean et al., 2020) and
emerging technologies in tourism (Park and Gretzel, 2007). Trust mainly emphasizes the
travelerâsperceptionofprivacyprotection,securityandqualityofinformationandservices
provided by chatbots. Travelers aresharingtheir personal details with chatbots fortheir
travel planning and booking which makes them skeptical about using these chatbots.
Thereforethehypothesisisproposed:
H4. PTRaffectstheAINofchatbotsfortourism.
3.5Anthropomorphism
ANM relates to the characteristics of human beings and the behavior of human beings
towardnon-humanthingssuchaschatbotsandrobots(Bartnecketal.,2009).Whenhuman
interactionhappens with a non-human entity,theperson will scrutinize thebehaviorand
featuresoftheentitytoinvestigatetheperceivedsimilarity(Sheehan,2018).Forexample,
when the tourists use chatbots for planning the tours, individuals tend to relate it with
humancustomercareexecutives.ANMofchatbotsisdiscussedintheliteraturethatusage
ofchatbotsforsmalltalksandconversationshasraisedtheperceptionofusersâregarding
chatbotâs credibility, intelligence, trust and engagement (Cassell and Bickmore, 2003).
Sheehan(2018)confirmsthepositivecorrelationofANMwithbehavioralintentiontouse
chatbots.Theextantliteraturediscussedthatcomputersandmachinescanbeconsideredas

also need to be tested for their human-like behavior as its voice quality, conversation

3.6Perceivedintelligence
Inpriorliterature,itisdiscussedinanexperimentthatthespeech,voiceandappearanceare

2017).ThePNTofachatbotorrobotisconsideredasitscompetence,efficiency,useandability

real-time solutions to travel bookings by solving problems related to travel planning and
scheduling.Hence,theassociationbetweenPNTandAINneedstobetested:
H6. PNTaffectstheAINofchatbotsfortourism.
3.7Adoptionintention
AIN is the subjective probability of an individualâs engagement in a certain behavior
(FishbeinandAjzen,1975).Behavioralintentionintendstoelucidateandenvisagetheusersâ
acceptanceofnewtechnology(Davis,1989;Martinsetal.,2014;FishbeinandAjzen,1975;

qualitative and quantitative techniques to confirm the reliability and consistency of the
conclusions (Kallmuenzer et al., 2019; Creswell et al., 2007). The research design for this
study was carried out in the three phases and the data from these two methods were
analyzed and validated. In phase one, initially subject matter experts (SMEs) from
the tourism industry and travel companies were interviewed to confirm and ensure the
accuratemeasuresforthesecondphaseofthequantitativesurvey.Thecharacterizationof
all the constructs was adapted from the operational definitions established in the extant
research (Table 1). The main themes that emerged from the various dimensions were

expressed their commitment to using AI-based chatbots and issues faced by them.
Managers are willing to use chatbots as they will save costs and will be able to provide
better and faster services through chatbots. The interview data depicts how PEA, PUL,

6.3Practicalimplications
This research provides critical insights for practitioners and managers by providing the
factors of AIN of chatbots in tourism. This study highlights some of the managerâs
viewpoints,whichcanbeconsideredtocomprehendtheadoptionofchatbotsinthetourism
industry.Marketersanddesignersoftourismchatbotsneedtoensurethatchatbotsareeasy
and simple to use as well as useful in the tour planning and travel management. In
consideration with H3, H4 and H5, developers of chatbots for tourism must ensure that
chatbots provide reliable information and intelligently automate the tourism industry by
providingreal-timesolutions.PTRisimportantforAINofchatbots(Kaushik,etal.,2015);
hence, trust needs to be ensured by providing authentic service through chatbots for
tourism.ANMisapredictorofAIN(Sheehan,2018),thereforedevelopersofchatbotsalso
need to ensure that chatbots have anthropomorphic characteristics so that users feel that
chatbotsarereal,livingandhuman-like.Designersanddeveloperscanensurethatchatbots
communicate in various languages which would provide a user-friendly interface to the
customers. Though TXN ((cid:3)0.139) did not influence AIN of chatbots for tourism,
the practitioners need to ensure that chatbots do not create any anxiety related to the
technology.Thedesignersneedtodevelopuser-friendlychatbotssothattechnologyanxiety

of chatbotsas per H8. Travelers areaccustomed to revisiting thetravelagentsfortravel
planning because of their traditional practice of doing so. In the Indian context, travel
agencies â Cox and Kings, Thomas Cook, SOTC, Kesari Tours and Club Mahindra â
maintain a strong relationship with the consumers. The chatbot providers also need to
ensure distinct and unique service features to offer delight for consumers to attract
consumer usage. Online travel agencies such as yatra.com, expedia.com, goibibo.com,
